# Product Requirements Document: Gravity Note

## Executive Summary

Gravity Note is a revolutionary note-taking application that eliminates the friction of idea capture by embracing radical simplicity. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "append-and-review" methodology, the app provides a single, time-reverse chronological stream where users can instantly capture thoughts without the cognitive overhead of organization, folders, or tags.

The product addresses the fundamental problem of "capture friction" that causes knowledge workers to lose valuable ideas because existing note-taking apps prioritize organization over immediate capture. By removing structural barriers and focusing solely on effortless input and natural review processes, Gravity Note enables users to externalize their working memory and achieve deeper focus on current tasks.

### Key Value Propositions:

- **Zero-friction capture**: Open app, type thought, done
- **Natural gravity metaphor**: Important ideas naturally rise through periodic review
- **Cognitive load reduction**: No decisions about where or how to organize
- **Serendipitous rediscovery**: Past ideas resurface organically during review
- **Cross-platform continuity**: Seamless synchronization across all devices

## Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement

To become the primary external working memory for creative knowledge workers, enabling them to capture every fleeting thought without friction and rediscover buried insights through natural review processes.

### Strategic Objectives

1. **Minimize capture friction** to the absolute theoretical limit
2. **Maximize idea retention** through foolproof persistence
3. **Enable serendipitous connections** between past and present thoughts
4. **Preserve user focus** by eliminating organizational decisions
5. **Scale gracefully** from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of notes

### Product Philosophy

- **Extreme minimalism**: Every feature must justify its cognitive cost
- **Time as the only structure**: No folders, tags, or categories
- **Gravity over organization**: Let natural review cycles surface important ideas
- **Capture over synthesis**: Optimize for input, not complex knowledge graphs
- **Trust through simplicity**: Users must have complete confidence in the system

## Market Analysis & User Research

### Target Market

**Primary**: Knowledge workers aged 25-45 who experience "idea overflow"

- Software developers and engineers
- Product managers and designers
- Researchers and academics
- Content creators and writers
