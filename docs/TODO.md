    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_rescued BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    original_note_id UUID REFERENCES notes(id)
);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_user_created ON notes (user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_content_search ON notes USING gin(to_tsvector('english', content));

-- Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own notes" ON notes FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own notes" ON notes FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
