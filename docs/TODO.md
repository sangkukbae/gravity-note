#### Offline Support Foundation - **CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** ✅ (September 1, 2025)

**✅ Offline Foundation Status**: Core offline architecture and draft persistence functionality fully implemented and verified through comprehensive E2E testing.

Goal: Ensure core note creation works offline with eventual consistency and zero data loss. Keep caching strategy minimal here; full PWA caching moves to Week 3.

- [x] **Step 0 — Dependencies & scaffolding** ✅ **COMPLETE**
  - [x] Add packages: SKIPPED — using Workbox CDN import; no npm deps required
  - [x] Create `public/sw.js` (custom service worker; Workbox via CDN import)
  - [x] Create `lib/pwa/register-sw.ts` and register from `app/layout.tsx` (client-only)
  - [x] Add basic versioning and update flow (prompt to reload on SW update)

- [x] **Step 1 — Offline detection & UX** ✅ **CORE COMPLETE**
  - [x] Create `hooks/use-offline-status.ts` (online/offline detection with ping fallback) - **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Show subtle offline banner/state in header and `NotesContainer` (UI indicators implemented)
  - [x] Keep capture always available; disable network-only actions; add "Saved locally" indicator

- [x] **Step 2 — Local draft backup (unsaved input)** ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE**
  - [x] Create `lib/offline/drafts.ts` using `localStorage` keyed by `userId` - **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
  - [x] Auto-restore draft on mount; clear after successful note creation - **VERIFIED WORKING**
  - [x] Guard against multi-tab conflicts (last-write-wins with timestamp) - **IMPLEMENTED**

- [x] **Step 3 — IndexedDB queue for note mutations** ✅ **ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE**
  - [x] Add `lib/offline/outbox.ts` with queue management architecture - **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Define `OfflineOperation` and related types in `types/offline.ts` - **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Implement helpers: queue operations, pending status management - **IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Store optimistic notes with `pending: true` and `clientId` - **UI INTEGRATION COMPLETE**

- [x] Step 4 — API proxy for mutations (server-side auth)
  - [x] Add `app/api/notes/route.ts` handling POST/PUT/DELETE via Supabase server client
  - [x] Use cookie-based auth; return `{ clientId, id }` mapping for reconciliation
  - [x] Validate input; enforce RLS and rate limits

- [x] Step 5 — Service worker + Background Sync
  - [x] In `public/sw.js`, import Workbox and set up:
    - [x] BackgroundSyncPlugin('notes-queue', { maxRetentionTime: 24h })
    - [x] Route POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/notes` with NetworkOnly + background sync
    - [x] Fallback: client-side manual sync on reconnect/visibility and button
  - [x] Hook `self.addEventListener('message')` for `SKIP_WAITING` (update flow); `sync` handled by Workbox plugin

- [x] Step 6 — Client integration in mutations
  - [x] Update `hooks/use-notes-mutations.ts` to call `/api/notes` via `fetch`
  - [x] On offline or fetch error: enqueue to IDB and optimistic-update UI (`pending`, `clientId`)
  - [x] On success: reconcile IDs, clear `pending`, update caches and ordering

- [x] Step 7 — Reconnect sync & retry policy
  - [x] Add `syncQueuedNotes()` with exponential backoff and jitter
  - [x] Trigger on `online` event and app focus; expose manual "Sync now" action
  - [ ] Telemetry counters: successes, failures, last sync time (pending)

- [x] Step 8 — Minimal caching (defer full PWA to Week 3)
  - [x] Verified via existing PWA configuration (app shell/static assets precached)
  - [x] Advanced caching strategies deferred to "Week 3: PWA Configuration" (already completed)

- [x] **Step 9 — Testing & reliability** ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE**
  - [x] Unit tests: queue helpers, network hook, reconciliation logic - **IMPLEMENTED** (`tests/utils/offline-*.test.ts`)
  - [x] E2E tests: offline create → online sync (Playwright with network simulation) - **COMPREHENSIVE SUITE** (`e2e/offline.spec.ts`)
  - [x] QA checklist for multi-tab and token refresh scenarios - **7 TEST CASES VERIFIED**

- [x] **Step 10 — Rollout & docs** ✅ **DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE**

  - [x] Add `docs/offline.md` with comprehensive design and architecture - **COMPLETE**
  - [ ] Track metrics in logs/analytics for sync health (pending implementation)

#### PWA Configuration - **COMPLETED** (September 2, 2025)

**✅ PWA Implementation Complete**: Full PWA capabilities, including installability, offline support, and caching strategies, have been implemented and verified.

Goal: Deliver an installable, reliable PWA. Ensure fast repeat loads via precache + smart runtime caching. This complements Week 2's offline queue.

- [x] Step 0 — Manifest & meta integration
  - [x] Create `public/manifest.webmanifest` (name, short_name, description, id, start_url, scope, display, theme_color, background_color)
  - [x] Reference manifest and theme color in `app/layout.tsx` head
  - [x] Add iOS meta tags: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, status bar style, `apple-touch-icon`

- [x] Step 1 — Icons & splash assets
  - [x] Add `pwa-asset-generator` as a dev dependency
  - [x] Generate icons (192, 512, maskable variants) to `public/icons/`
  - [x] (Optional) Generate iOS splash screens to `public/splash/`
  - [x] Wire generated assets into manifest and `<head>`

- [x] Step 2 — Offline page and routing
  - [x] Create `app/offline/page.tsx` with minimal, cache-friendly UI
  - [x] Link from error states so users can reach help offline
  - [x] Add copy explaining what still works offline (note capture, queued sync)

- [x] Step 3 — Service worker precache (static app shell)
  - [x] In `public/sw.js`, precache: `'/'`, `'/offline'`, `'/manifest.webmanifest'`, `'/favicon.ico'`, icons/splash assets
  - [x] Version caches and implement cleanup on `activate`
  - [x] Claim clients so refresh is not required on first install

- [x] Step 4 — Runtime caching strategies
  - [x] Next static assets `/_next/static/*`: CacheFirst with 1-year expiration
  - [x] App images from `public/*`: StaleWhileRevalidate with size/time caps
  - [x] Google Fonts: CSS (StaleWhileRevalidate), font files (CacheFirst)
  - [x] Supabase storage assets (public objects): CacheFirst with safe TTL
  - [x] API GET requests (non-auth critical): NetworkFirst with short cache + timeout
  - [x] Exclude auth/mutation routes from cache; rely on Week 2 background sync

- [x] Step 5 — Navigation fallback
  - [x] Use NetworkFirst for navigations with `fetch` handler
  - [x] Serve `'/offline'` when both network and cache miss
  - [x] Enable Navigation Preload for faster responses when online

- [x] Step 6 — Install prompts & appinstalled telemetry
  - [x] Create `hooks/use-add-to-home-prompt.ts` to capture `beforeinstallprompt`
  - [x] Add "Install app" action to header/user menu when supported
  - [x] Track `appinstalled` and prompt outcomes (accept/dismiss)

- [x] Step 7 — Update flow & versioning
  - [x] Enhance `lib/pwa/register-sw.ts` to handle waiting SW and prompt to reload
  - [x] Decide on `skipWaiting` policy (immediate vs deferred update)
  - [x] Surface unobtrusive toast to apply updates

- [x] Step 8 — iOS specifics
  - [x] Validate standalone mode and status bar styling on iOS Safari
  - [x] Ensure `apple-touch-icon` sizes exist and are referenced
  - [x] Document iOS limitations (no Background Sync, limited storage)

- [x] Step 9 — Build, serve, and validate
  - [x] Use `pnpm build && pnpm start` to test SW/manifest (dev SW is unreliable)
  - [x] Validate with Chrome DevTools (Application tab) and Lighthouse PWA audit
  - [x] Test install/uninstall flows on Android and iOS (Add to Home Screen)

- [x] Step 10 — Rollout & docs
  - [x] Gate under `PWA_ENABLED` feature flag for staged rollout
  - [x] Add `docs/PWA_CONFIGURATION.md` with decisions and troubleshooting
  - [x] Monitor performance metrics and error rates after enabling
